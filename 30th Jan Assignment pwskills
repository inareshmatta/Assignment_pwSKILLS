#Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example

count = 1

while count <= 5:

```
while loops are useful when you want to repeat a block of code an unknown number of times, or until a certain condition is met. For example, you might use a while loop to keep reading input from the user until they enter a valid value, or to repeat a calculation until it converges to a certain value.

It's important to be careful when using while loops, as they can cause infinite loops if the condition never becomes false. To avoid this, make sure that the condition will eventually become false, and include a way to increment a counter or change the condition inside the loop so that it will eventually terminate.

# Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern. 

rows = 5

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print("*", end="")
    print("")

# Output:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****

rows = 5

for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print("")

# Output:
# *****
# ****
# ***
# **
# *

rows = 5

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(rows - i - 1):
        print(end=" ")
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print("")

# Output:
#     * 
#    * *

Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1

number = 10

while number >= 1:
    print(number)
    number -= 1

# Output:
# 10
# 9
# 8
# 7
# 6
# 5
# 4
# 3
# 2
# 1
